This is a calculator program with GUI that I write in Python. You can calculate main operations and modes. The numbers will get smaller to fit in the screen as you type and you can see what you already typed on the top left. It has standart "C" and "CE" functionality of calculators as well. 

Just run "My Calculator.py"
